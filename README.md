If you prefer to run it on your phone with the expo app, scan the QR-code provided by the start script.

## Problems
if you get a timeout in the expo-app, check your network metrics. The comment from Himujjal on this [community-site](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/issues/60#issuecomment-317104728) saved my day.
